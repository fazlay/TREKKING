            experience. I couldn’t imagine that a trek could be that good! It
            was my first experience trekking, in snow, travelling alone, without
            connectivity, just with friends I made on the trek, it was amazing!
            The Indiahikes team even made a cake for a friend, whose birthday it
            was! Now all my trek friends and I can talk about are treks!”{' '}
